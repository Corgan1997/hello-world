# hello-world
Currently I am enrolled with IvyTech and taking Data Informatics 109 as my course. Looking to explore topics and engage in discussions.
I am 25 years of age and taking courses through IvyTech to earn my Cetificate in, Deparment of Defense Logistics. After graduation I plan on gaining a job with either a 3rd party goverment contractor, or working with the naval branch in the Logistics department. So far in my last class, Principles of Procurement, I gained vital knowledge about how the procurement process works. Through the intial discussing needs and goals, through the the process of establishing supplier relationships, making requestion for purchases, and how to properly select a suplier by establishing a criteteria to which meets your organizaiton's needs. I also learned about the terms and conditions of a contact, how to build a contract to make a pruchase, and various legal terms to secure a benificial contract.  My current class I am learning important information which pretains to how data is collected, analyzed, and distrubuted. Also how buiesness use the data efficiently to make decisions, to gain a better view on the market they provide a service to. As well as selection of software, hardware, data storage, and the entire process that data is taken from input to output.
